# Deployment Resolution Plan

## 1. Project Assessment and Diagnostic Phase

1. **Confirm project structure and configuration**
   - Verify the project type (React/Vite vs Next.js)
   - Locate and review key configuration files: `vite.config.ts`/`next.config.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
   - Check for any environment-specific configuration

2. **Local vs. Vercel environment comparison**
   - Review Node.js versions (check `package.json` engines field)
   - Compare build commands between local development and Vercel settings
   - Identify any absolute path references that might break in production

3. **API Integration audit**
   - Review how APIs (OpenAI, YouTube, MyAnimeList, AniList, TMDb) are accessed
   - Check for any client-side API calls that should be server-side
   - Verify API key handling and environment variable usage

4. **Database connection investigation**
   - Examine Redis and Neon database connection configurations
   - Check for proper environment variable handling for DB credentials
   - Look for hardcoded connection strings or development-specific settings

## 2. Local Build Verification

1. **Clean build test**
   - Run `npm ci` (or equivalent) to ensure clean dependencies
   - Execute production build command (`npm run build`)
   - Test the production build locally with `npm run preview` (Vite) or `npm start` (Next.js)

2. **Environment variable management**
   - Create `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.env.production` files as needed
   - Ensure proper prefixing of environment variables (VITE_ for Vite, NEXT_PUBLIC_ for Next.js)
   - Test with production-like environment variables locally

## 3. Vercel-Specific Configuration

1. **Update Vercel configuration**
   - Modify `vercel.json` based on the actual framework:
     - For Vite:
       ```json
       {
         "version": 2,
         "framework": "vite",
         "buildCommand": "npm run build",
         "outputDirectory": "dist",
         "routes": [
           { "handle": "filesystem" },
           { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
         ],
         "installCommand": "npm install"
       }
       ```
     - For Next.js:
       ```json
       {
         "version": 2,
         "framework": "nextjs",
         "buildCommand": "next build",
         "devCommand": "next dev",
         "installCommand": "npm install"
       }
       ```

2. **Adapt for serverless architecture**
   - Move API calls to serverless functions if necessary
   - Check for long-running operations that might time out in serverless environment
   - Ensure Redis connections are properly closed after use

3. **Environment variable setup**
   - Transfer all environment variables to Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure proper naming (with appropriate prefix for the framework)
   - Set up any necessary environment variable encryption

## 4. Deployment Strategy

1. **Progressive deployment**
   - Start with a minimal viable version that removes complex integrations
   - Add back features one by one with testing between additions
   - Use Vercel preview deployments for testing changes

2. **Troubleshooting 404 errors**
   - Check client-side routing configuration
   - Review Vercel routing configuration in `vercel.json`
   - Ensure SPA fallback is properly configured

3. **Database connection optimization**
   - Implement connection pooling for Neon database
   - Use Redis connection management best practices
   - Test database connections in isolation

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

1. **Enhance error reporting**
   - Add comprehensive error logging
   - Consider implementing Sentry or similar error tracking
   - Enable detailed build logs in Vercel

2. **Health checks**
   - Create API health check endpoints
   - Implement database connection tests
   - Add monitoring for third-party API availability

## 6. Framework-Specific Optimizations

### For Vite Projects
- Ensure proper handling of static assets
- Check for any Vite plugins that might require additional configuration
- Verify that browser compatibility is properly handled (via browserslist or similar)

### For Next.js Projects
- Verify API routes handling
- Check for proper usage of `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, etc.
- Ensure Next.js routing is correctly configured

## 7. Final Verification and Documentation

1. **Comprehensive testing**
   - Test all API integrations in production environment
   - Verify database operations
   - Check for any performance issues or memory leaks

2. **Document deployment process**
   - Create a deployment checklist
   - Document any environment-specific configurations
   - Note any workarounds or special considerations
