# Image Handling Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the image handling in the anime recommendation system.

## Background

The recommendation system was having issues with TMDb images not consistently appearing in the recommendations UI. After investigation, we found that while the TMDb API was working correctly, there were issues with how the URLs were being managed and fallbacks were being handled.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Image URL Validation

We created a comprehensive validation tool (`reconcile-tmdb-data.js`) that:
- Tests TMDb API access for popular anime titles
- Validates all image URLs by making actual HEAD requests
- Generates a comprehensive mapping of AniList IDs to guaranteed working TMDb image URLs

### 2. Manual Mappings Enhancement

We enhanced the manual-mappings.ts file to:
- Add proper imageUrl fields for popular anime titles
- Add a new helper function `getImageUrlFromManualMapping()` to access these URLs
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Multiple Fallback Layers

We implemented multiple layers of fallbacks in both server and client components:

#### Server-side (recommendations/route.ts):
- First try: Use the new manual mapping system to get guaranteed TMDb URLs
- Second try: Use any TMDb URL found via API lookup
- Third try: Fall back to AniList image if available
- Final fallback: Use a colored placeholder with the anime title

#### Client-side (AnimeCard.tsx):
- First try: Use the image URL provided (usually from server)
- Second try: Dynamically load manual mappings and try to get a TMDb URL
- Third try: Use MAL image if available
- Final fallback: Generate a colored placeholder

### 4. Mock Data Enhancement

We updated the mock data used for testing to:
- Use real AniList IDs for popular titles
- Include validated TMDb image URLs
- Ensure consistency in testing environments

### 5. Diagnostic Tools

We created several diagnostic tools:
- `reconcile-tmdb-data.js`: Validates TMDb image URLs
- `test-recommendations-api.js`: Tests the recommendations API
- `verify-images.sh`: Wrapper script to run validation checks

## Testing

We've verified that:
- All hardcoded TMDb image URLs return 200 status codes
- The mapping system correctly associates AniList IDs with TMDb images
- The fallback system works as expected, with multiple layers of protection
- Our mock data now includes high-quality images for testing

## Conclusion

With these improvements, popular anime titles will now consistently display high-quality images from TMDb, regardless of API or network issues. The layered fallback system ensures that users will always see an appropriate image, even if the primary source is unavailable.

The system is now more resilient to:
- Network failures
- API rate limiting
- Cross-origin issues
- Missing data in external APIs
